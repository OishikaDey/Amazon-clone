    <h1 >HELLO !</h1>
 <p>Hi, I'm Oishika Dey!
I'm an aspiring web developer, just beginning my journey into the world of web design and programming. Right now, I'm learning HTML and exploring how websites are built from the ground up.
I'm curious, creative, and love solving problems. I enjoy spending time experimenting with code, reading about new technologies, and building small personal projects to improve my skills.
Outside of tech, I enjoy listening to music, watching educational videos, and spending time with friends and family. My goal is to become a full-stack developer someday and work on meaningful projects that help people.

 <h2><u>About Me</u> </h2> 
<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I did my schooling at Vivekananda Mission School, Joka, Kolkata.It was there that I built a strong foundation in subjects like science, math, and especially computers.<br> I always looked forward to computer lab sessions—they were my first real exposure to how technology works, and I found them fascinating.<br>
    I graduated with 97.8% in ICSE and 98.75% in ISC. I secured 5th rank all over India and was felicitated by the West Bengal government for this achievement.<br>
     I received books, a laptop, sweets, chocolates, gifts like a couple’s wristwatch, a medal, and certificates. Friends, family, relatives, and teachers showered me with warm wishes, and my parents were my constant support.<br> I worked really hard to reach this position. 
     I also attempted JEE but couldn’t crack JEE, so I joined KIIT (Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology) in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.<br>During this time, I developed a deeper interest in the digital world.<br>
      I often spent extra time learning about the internet, websites, and how coding works. Even though I didn’t have a formal course in programming at first, I started exploring HTML tutorials online out of pure curiosity.<br>
These school and college experiences helped shape my interest in technology and gave me the confidence to start learning web development on my own. <br>
I’m now excited to continue this journey and eventually become a skilled developer. This is where I live now, staying in a hostel.</p>
