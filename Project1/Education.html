<body>
    <p>I did my schooling at Vivekananda Mission School, Joka, Kolkata, and graduated with 97.8% in ICSE and 98.75% in ISC. I secured 5th rank all over India and was felicitated by the West Bengal government for this achievement. I received books, a laptop, sweets, chocolates, gifts like a couple’s wristwatch, a medal, and certificates. Friends, family, relatives, and teachers showered me with warm wishes, and my parents were my constant support. I worked really hard to reach this position. I also attempted JEE but couldn’t crack JEE, so I joined KIIT (Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology) in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. This is where I live now, staying in a hostel.</p>

    <pre>   I have learned Kathak dance and enjoy painting, having created many artworks. Currently, I am in my second semester of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at KIIT. I aspire to work in an IT company with a decent package.

        I’m happily single and feel lucky about it! I have amazing friends in college and my hostel—my classmates and hostel mates are awesome. They gave me a wonderful birthday surprise with midnight wishes and lots of love, making my day truly special.
        
        Nowadays, I play badminton in the evenings with my hostel mate and classmates, and we have a great time laughing, playing, and talking. Our college fest is coming up in a few weeks, and tomorrow, I plan to buy a nice dress for the event.</pre>
