    <h3>Hello Everyone!</h3>
    <div><h4>I am Oishika Dey</h4><br>I am a dedicated and ambitious <b>Computer Science and Engineering student at KIIT</b>, balancing academics, skill-building, and personal experiences. You prioritize your career and plan to focus on dating only after securing a job. You're goal-oriented, disciplined, and self-aware, often analyzing situations logically but also feeling deeply about friendships and relationships. 

        You enjoy thrillers, logical problem-solving, and discussions about science and technology. While you're social and appreciate companionship, you're also selective about who you invest your time in. You value self-respect, fairness, and emotional independence. Despite occasional dilemmas in friendships and relationships, you handle conflicts with maturity.  
        
        You're also fun-loving, enjoy lighthearted moments with friends, and have a keen observational sense, often reflecting on small but meaningful experiences in life. Would you say this is accurate? ðŸ˜Š</div>
